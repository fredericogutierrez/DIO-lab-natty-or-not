# Dev Z

## 📒 Descrição
Dev Z is a 2D avatar created to tell a bit about his routine as a full-stack developer at a multinational company.
He has the personality of a tired, ironic, bored, and rarely excited developer.

## 🤖 Tecnologias Utilizadas
*ChatGPT - prompt;
*ImageFX - imagem;
*Kling - video.

## 🧐 Processo de Criação
Dev Z was inspired by Jenkins from South Park.

First, I created a prompt describing Jenkins using ChatGPT.

I used ImageFX to generate the image of Dev Z, and then I used Kling to give the character life and expression.

## 💭 Reflexão (Opcional)
Initially, the most challenging part was finding an AI that could generate an image I liked, that wasn't paid for, and that could also bring the character to life.
